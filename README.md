This project aimed to develop a model for predicting Titanic passenger survival based on features such as passenger class, sex, and age. The analysis revealed a strong correlation between these features and survival outcomes, allowing the model to accurately predict survival probabilities.

Furthermore, the model demonstrates good overall accuracy and reliability, with an accuracy score of approximately 81%. This indicates that the model correctly predicts the survival outcome for a significant portion of the passengers. Evaluation using a confusion matrix further supports the model's performance, revealing its strengths and weaknesses in classifying survivors and non-survivors.

The model effectively predicts Titanic passenger survival based on key factors like passenger class, sex, and age, achieving ~81% accuracy.
